# femtosat_parser
A parser for the BYU Spacecraft FemtoSat launch project. Follows a very specific format for now with plans to make it more flexible.

## Future Updates
### Parser 2 - Refine current setup
- Create function so it automatically pares the data down to right before and right after the launch
- Edit the x scale so that it is right before launch
- Dynamically edit launch data so each start at the same time

### Parser 3 - Make more flexible
- Edit so that you can easily configure what sorts of graphics you want to generate
- Edit to turn code into a general library, so you can call functions to create graphics
- Change so the code can read in a header format and adjust the generated graph
